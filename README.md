1. Sidebar text : <br> 1. DNS : Paul Mockapetris expanded the Internet beyond its academic origins by inventing the Domain Name System (DNS) in 1983. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources. Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. 
2. Email : A widely accepted story of email’s origins involves a computer engineer named Ray Tomlinson who was working on an early version of the internet in 1971.
3. HTTP & WWW : Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. This is like the language you use to order your goods.HTTP and the World Wide Web One of the most commonly used services on the Internet is the World Wide Web (WWW). The application protocol that makes the web work is Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP. HTTP is a connectionless text-based protocol. 
4. TCP/IP : Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet. This is like the transport mechanisms that let you place an order, go to the shop, and buy your goods. In our example, this is like a car or a bike (or however else you might get around).
5. HTML : HTML is the language used to write web pages. The HTML file can reference CSS and JavaScript, either in external files via `<link>` and `<script>` elements respectively, or embedded in the HTML page via `<style>` and `<script>` elements.
6. IP Address : A unique string of characters that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network. An Internet Protocol address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing. 
7. Packets : Data sent over the internet is called a message, but before messages get sent, they're broken up into tinier parts called packets. These messages and packets travel from one source to the next using Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP).
8. Wires, Cables & Wi-Fi : Bits of information are sent by electricity, light, and radio waves, Bandwidth is the maximum transmission capacity of a device, measured in bits per second Latency is the time it takes for one bit to travel from the sender to the receiver	Fiber-optic cable is a thread of glass that reflects light, and signal does not degrade over long distances	Wireless typically uses radio signal to send bits	Sending device translates binary into different radio frequency waves; the receiver does the reverse, and translates the frequency waves back into binary.

2. Page Title : Search engines, Web browsers & Web servers <br>
3. Description: Information about the history of search engines, web browsers, and web servers.
<p>Search Engine : The first internet search engines predate the debut of the Web in December 1990: Who is user search dates back to 1982, and the Knowbot Information Service multi-network user search was first implemented in 1989. The first well documented search engine that searched content files, namely FTP files, was Archie, which debuted on 10 September 1990. </p><p> Web Browsers : A browser is software that accesses and displays pages and files on the web. Browsers require a connection to the Internet (e.g., through a cable modem, a direct Ethernet connection, or Wi-Fi). Tim Berners-Lee is credited with developing, in 1990, both the first web server, and the first web browser, called Worldwide Web (no spaces) and later renamed Nexus. </p><p> Browser wars: The World Wide Web gained rapid acceptance with the creation of a Web browser called Mosaic, which was developed in the United States by Marc Andreessen and others at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois and was released in September 1993. </p>

<p> The first popular search engine on the Web was Yahoo! Search. The first product from Yahoo!, founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994, was a Web directory called Yahoo! Directory. In 1995, a search function was added, allowing users to search Yahoo! Soon after, a number of search engines appeared and vied for popularity. These included Magellan, Excite, Infoseek, Inktomi, Northern Light, and AltaVista. Information seekers could also browse the directory instead of doing a keyword-based search. In 1996, Robin Li developed the RankDex site-scoring algorithm for search engines results page ranking and received a US patent for the technology. It was the first search engine that used hyperlinks to measure the quality of websites it was indexing, predating the very similar algorithm patent filed by Google two years later in 1998. Larry Page referenced Li's work in some of his U.S. patents for PageRank. Li later used his Rankdex technology for the Baidu search engine, which was founded by Robin Li in China and launched in 2000. In 1996, Netscape was looking to give a single search engine an exclusive deal as the featured search engine on Netscape's web browser. There was so much interest that instead Netscape struck deals with five of the major search engines: for $5 million a year, each search engine would be in rotation on the Netscape search engine page. The five engines were Yahoo!, Magellan, Lycos, Infoseek, and Excite. Google adopted the idea of selling search terms in 1998, from a small search engine company named goto.com. This move had a significant effect on the SE business, which went from struggling to one of the most profitable businesses in the Internet. Search engines were also known as some of the brightest stars in the Internet investing frenzy that occurred in the late 1990s. Several companies entered the market spectacularly, receiving record gains during their initial public offerings. Some have taken down their public search engine, and are marketing enterprise-only editions, such as Northern Light. Many search engine companies were caught up in the dot-com bubble, a speculation-driven market boom that peaked in 1990 and ended in 2000. A search engine helps find information in the World Wide Web. Once the information has been found, the results are displayed in one place. It helps gather information from multiple URL’s and helps maintain it. It has its own database. Examples of search engines include Google, Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckgo, Baidu Internet Explorer, Excite. </p>
<p> Web Browsers : A browser is software that accesses and displays pages and files on the web. Browsers require a connection to the Internet (e.g., through a cable modem, a direct Ethernet connection, or Wi-Fi). Tim Berners-Lee is credited with developing, in 1990, both the first web server, and the first web browser, called Worldwide Web (no spaces) and later renamed Nexus. </p>
<p> A browser war is competition for dominance in the usage share of web browsers. The "First Browser War" during the late 1990s pitted Microsoft's Internet Explorer against Netscape's Navigator. By mid-1995, the World Wide Web had received a great deal of attention in popular culture and the mass media. Netscape Navigator was the most widely used web browser and Microsoft had licensed Mosaic to create Internet Explorer 1.0. </p>

<p>Web Server: By the end of 1990, Tim Berners-Lee developed the first Web server. The Web server is a software which provides these documents when requested by web browsers. Web server sees and approves those requests made by web browsers and sends the document in response. Web server provide an area to store the website. Web server can be installed anywhere but it needs to be on a network or on local computer. Example: Apache Server </p>

There were concerns that computer systems would have trouble changing their clock and calendar systems from 1999 to 2000 which might trigger wider social or economic problems, but there was virtually no impact or disruption due to adequate preparation. </p> <br> <p> People Power : The code for Napster, a music sharing service, was finished in June 1999.

<p> However, as an online store, Amazon had no such limitations. It could carry countless titles, from best sellers to obscure texts. Since its founding, Amazon has expanded to the point that it now offers virtually every type of product imaginable – including eBooks and movies. Amazon also pioneered the sharing of user reviews, an idea that was originally considered eCommerce suicide. Of course, the exact opposite happened. By letting customers share their feedback, Amazon became one of the most powerful companies in the world seemingly overnight. Meanwhile, eBay emerged as a successful online auction website, debuting in 1995. In 2005, Etsy launched as a global marketplace where people could create shops to sell their unique and often handmade items. During that same year, Amazon launched Amazon Prime, a service that offered members free two-day shipping within the continental United States. This program set a standard in eCommerce, forcing other merchants to decrease shipping time and charges. PayPal launched in 1998 as a global eCommerce company that offered payment processing for online vendors and other commercial users. PayPal customers can hold, send, and receive funds in many different currencies. In 2004, the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council was created to make sure that businesses comply with security requirements. This organization develops and implements security standards for account data protection. As mobile computing began to develop and grow, Amazon launched its first mobile website in 2001, starting the mobile eCommerce race. Because more people were using their mobile devices to access eCommerce websites, the push to make mobile sales possible was strong. Consumers today use mobile devices not only for purchases but also for product research, to find coupons, and to engage via social media.</p>
<p> Dot-com bubble: On January 31, 1999, two dot-com companies had purchased ad spots for Super Bowl XXXIII; that number increased to 17 the next year. Around the turn of the millennium, spending on technology was volatile as companies prepared for the Year 2000 problem. There were concerns that computer systems would have trouble changing their clock and calendar systems from 1999 to 2000 which might trigger wider social or economic problems, but there was virtually no impact or disruption due to adequate preparation. </p>
<p> On January 10, 2000, America Online, led by Steve Case and Ted Leonsis, announced a merger with Time Warner, led by Gerald M. Levin. The merger was the largest to date and was questioned by many analysts. On January 30, 2000, almost 20 percent (12 ads) of the 61 ads for Super Bowl XXXIV were purchased by dot-coms (however this estimate ranges from 12 to 19 companies depending on the source and the context in which the term "dot-com" company implies). At that time, the cost for a 30-second commercial cost between $1.9 million and $2.2 million. On March 15, 2000, Yahoo! and eBay ended merger talks and the Nasdaq fell 2.6%, but the S&P 500 rose 2.4% as investors shifted from strong performing technology stocks to poor performing established stocks.</p>

<p> By October 1999, Napster was taking up about 75 – 80% of the available bandwidth of US universities, and had more than 1 million downloads, making it the fastest spreading software Howard King and Peter Paterno, LA Entertainment lawyers, set out to warn music artists that Napster posed a clear and present danger to their careers On May 3, 2000, a member of the band Metallica arrived at Napster headquarters to ask that 300,000 users with Metallica songs to be banned from Napster Hillary Rosen and the RIAA filed a lawsuit for copyright, forcing Napster to be shut down in July 2001, This led to Steve Jobs, founder and CEO of Apple, to come out with iTunes, where users could download songs for $0.99, with strict copy protection, Viacom launched a $1 billion suit against YouTube for copyright issues, Google acquired YouTube at the end of 2006, so shutting down YouTube is not as easy as shutting down Napster, At this point, a new era of the Internet was being born, where users create their own content, and share and sell it,	Social networking was born in the wake of the dot com crash, Web 2.0 is about setting communication free, and users can share their thoughts with other users; in a sense, the web belongs to the people </p>
