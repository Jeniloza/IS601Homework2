1. Sidebar text : <br> 1. DNS : Paul Mockapetris expanded the Internet beyond its academic origins by inventing the Domain Name System (DNS) in 1983. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources. Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. 
2. Email : A widely accepted story of emailâ€™s origins involves a computer engineer named Ray Tomlinson who was working on an early version of the internet in 1971.
3. HTTP & WWW : Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. This is like the language you use to order your goods.HTTP and the World Wide Web One of the most commonly used services on the Internet is the World Wide Web (WWW). The application protocol that makes the web work is Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP. HTTP is a connectionless text-based protocol. 
4. TCP/IP : Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet. This is like the transport mechanisms that let you place an order, go to the shop, and buy your goods. In our example, this is like a car or a bike (or however else you might get around).
5. HTML : HTML is the language used to write web pages. The HTML file can reference CSS and JavaScript, either in external files via `<link>` and `<script>` elements respectively, or embedded in the HTML page via `<style>` and `<script>` elements.
6. IP Address : A unique string of characters that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network. An Internet Protocol address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing. 
7. Packets : Data sent over the internet is called a message, but before messages get sent, they're broken up into tinier parts called packets. These messages and packets travel from one source to the next using Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP).
8. Wires, Cables & Wi-Fi : Bits of information are sent by electricity, light, and radio waves, Bandwidth is the maximum transmission capacity of a device, measured in bits per second Latency is the time it takes for one bit to travel from the sender to the receiver	Fiber-optic cable is a thread of glass that reflects light, and signal does not degrade over long distances	Wireless typically uses radio signal to send bits	Sending device translates binary into different radio frequency waves; the receiver does the reverse, and translates the frequency waves back into binary.
